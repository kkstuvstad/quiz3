# quiz3

For this quiz, I used QGIS to generate QTiles, which are images of an area at a given zoom level on a grid around the world. For the ones that I generated, I set it from a zoom level of 5 to 14, with the level 5 zoom image showing the northeastern U.S. and the level 14 zoom image showing a detailed portion of the town. The area of interest was Scranton, Pennsylvania. It is a city in northeastern Pennsylvania in the northeastern U.S., over 100 miles north of Philadelphia. Scranton is also the site of the ficticious company "Dunder Mifflin" from the TV show "The Office".
