# quiz3

For this quiz, I used QGIS to generate QTiles, which are images of an area at a given zoom level on a grid around the world. For the ones that I generated, I set it from a zoom level of 5 to 14, with the level 5 zoom image (11.png) showing the northeastern U.S. and the level 14 zoom image showing a detailed portion of the town. The area of interest was Scranton, Pennsylvania. It is a city in northeastern Pennsylvania., over 100 miles north of Philadelphia. Scranton is also the site of the fictitious company "Dunder Mifflin" from the TV show "The Office".
