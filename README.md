# quiz3

For this quiz, I used QGIS to generate QTiles, which are images of an area at a given zoom level on a grid around the world. For the ones that I generated, I set it from a zoom level of 5 to 14, with the level 5 zoom image (11.png) displaying the northeastern U.S. and the level 14 zoom image (6118.png) displaying a detailed portion of Scranton, Pennsylvania. A few other images at different zoom levels are also displayed, which include other towns in Pennsylvania and New York state. Scranton is a city in northeastern Pennsylvania., over 100 miles north of Philadelphia. Scranton is known for being the site of a fictitious paper company "Dunder Mifflin" from the TV show "The Office". Attacked below is a table containing the image names and their respective zoom levels.

Image Name | Zoom Level
-----------|-------------
11.png     | 5
6118.png   | 14
